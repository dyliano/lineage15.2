# lineage15.2
Up to 0.0.9-beta all the versioning is arbitrary as the changelog was lost to the ravages of space and time. 0.1.0 onwards should be versioned according to the major, minor, patch system.

Instructions:

    Make sure TWRP has been installed and is functional.
    Download the latest build and vendor.
    Reboot to Recovery
    Wipe data and cache (required if you are not currently using LOS and are coming from OneUI or SamExp.)
    Install Vendor image to Vendor partition.
    Flash the latest build
    If you are on and beyond April Patch (OneUI), do not flash a found Oreo Firmware as you will lose Baseband (Sim, Network, RIL). There is also no need to change firmware.
    Reboot to System.
